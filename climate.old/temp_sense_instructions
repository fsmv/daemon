Requires `sudo modprobe [module]` for w1-gpio and w1-therm. I'm sure there's
some config file I can put these in to make it automatic.

The data pin must be connected to gpio pin 4 of the Pi.

ls /sys/bus/w1/devices/ to find the folders for each device. There's also a
w1_bus_masterN folder which we can ignore.

Inside the device folder there is a w1_slave file which when read, gets a
temperature reading from the device. It looks like this:

8a 01 4b 46 7f ff 06 10 2c : crc=2c YES
8a 01 4b 46 7f ff 06 10 2c t=24625

The YES means the checksum passed, the t=##### is the temperature in celsius
multiplied by 1000.

Or you can take the first two bytes (lsb first then msb) and multiply by 0.0625.
This multiplier works only in 12 bit accuracy mode. Check the datasheet on page
6 for the multiplier values for different accuracy modes.

datasheet: https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX31820.pdf

On Page 9 of the datasheet (figure 4) there's a listing for what each byte of
the message means. In particular there is a config byte which tells you what the
current accuracy mode is.

I'm not sure that the w1 (one-wire) kernel module supports changing the accuracy
mode, but it seems to default to 12 bits, that's what the temp sensor defaults
to on boot.
